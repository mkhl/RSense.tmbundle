= RSense based code completion for TextMate

This Bundle brings rudimentary support for RSense (http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/index.html) code completion to TextMate.  This Bundle is currently very simple, but working and likely to change in the near future.

== Requirements

RSense.tmbundle uses the command line interface to RSense and has the same requirements as RSense: http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/manual.html#Requirements . In particular a working JRE must be installed.

== Installation

  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
  git clone http://github.com/eandrejko/RSense.tmbundle.git

== Usage

Complete the name of a method using Option + Esc.  The method completion is content-aware:

  module MyModule
    def self.foo(a)
      a.to_s.upcase
    end
  end

  MyModule::foo("bar").st

with the caret at the last position would offer completions "strip", "strip!" and "start_with?".
